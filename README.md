The `gtl` LaTeX package provides tools to manipulate lists of
tokens which may be unbalanced.

This package requires up-to-date versions of the `l3kernel`,
`l3packages` and `l3experimental` bundles.

The package is extracted by running `pdflatex gtl.ins`.
For documentation, run `pdflatex gtl.dtx` twice.

This is work in progress, all suggestions/comments/bug reports are
welcome!
