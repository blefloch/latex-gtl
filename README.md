The `gtl` TeX/LaTeX package provides tools to manipulate lists of
tokens which may be unbalanced.

The package is extracted by running `pdflatex gtl.ins`.
For documentation, run `pdflatex gtl.dtx` thrice.

This is work in progress, all suggestions/comments/bug reports
are welcome!  See https://github.com/blefloch/latex-gtl
